# ‚öîÔ∏è OpenHands PR Arena ‚öîÔ∏è

*OpenHands PR Arena* is a competitive framework for coding assistants designed to evaluate and benchmark frontier large language models (LLMs) through paired pull request (PR) generations. It enables developers to compare multiple LLMs in real-world issue resolution tasks by presenting side-by-side code edits and allowing human users to select the better fix.

This project is built upon [OpenHands GitHub Backlog Resolver](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/resolver) and inspired by [Copilot Arena](https://github.com/lmarena/copilot-arena), an open source AI coding assistant that provides paired autocomplete completions from different LLMs.

Follow the instruction below to setup the Arena setting for the OpenHands resolver.

## How to Get Started with the OpenHands PR Arena GitHub App

**‚≠êÔ∏è You can use PR-Arena without the API Key for limited time!**

### How to use

**‚≠êÔ∏è Please watch the [guideline video](https://youtu.be/BV2Rj_zlk2g) that explains how to use the OpenHands PR Arena GitHub App!**

1. Install OpenHands PR Arena to your GitHub repository.
    - [Installation Link](https://github.com/apps/openhands-pr-arena/installations/new)
2. Under `Repository access`, select the repositories you'd like to install the App to, then go to one of the installed repositories.
3. Label an issue with `pr-arena` to trigger the automated fix:
    - Open or create an issue, click `Labels` in the sidebar, and type `pr-arena`.
4. Wait approximately 10 minutes (up to 20 minutes) for the agent to resolve the issue and open the Arena.
5. Click the link in the comment to enter the Arena and choose your preferred model.
6. The selected fix will be automatically submitted as a Pull Request.

**‚≠êÔ∏è Progress is updated via comments on the issue‚Äîkeep an eye on them!**
**‚≠êÔ∏è OpenHands PR Arena uses frontier models to resolve issues‚Äîenjoy it for free for a limited time!**

## Privacy Notification
1. The only code we collect is the `git_diff` generated during issue resolution. We **never** collect the entire codebase and **never** release any user data.
2. **Do not** modify the injected workflow. Once modified, it will no longer be triggered.
3. Please use the App only on repositories where you consent to having your code processed by the LLM provider.
4. The following metadata is collected for research purpose:
    - User info: `owner`, `repo`, `repo URL`
    - Model info: `user preference on model`, `duration of an attempt`
    - Code info: `agent code (git_diffs)`, `commit hash` 

‚ö†Ô∏è We **do not** access or store your full codebase at any point.

##  Q&A
**Q. How can I track the progress?**

A. The agent will automatically **comment on the issue** at each stage of the process:
  - `PR-Arena workflow triggered successfully! üéâ ...`
    - Step 0. Tips and instructions to guide you through the PR-Arena workflow.
  - `OpenHands started fixing the issue! You can monitor the progress [here]`
    - Step 1. OpenHands begins resolving the issue. Please wait 10 ~ 20 minutes for the next comment.
  - `‚öîÔ∏èPR-Arena is now open‚öîÔ∏è! You can view the proposed fixes and make a decision at [this link]`
    - Step 2. The Arena is open. Click the link to review both fixes and choose your preferred one.
  - `PR has been created based on the fix you've selected. Please review the changes.`
    - Step 3. A pull request has been created. You can now review and merge it.

**Q. What happens if an error occurs?**

A. If an error occurs, the agent will comment on the issue with an appropriate message. You can retry by removing the `pr-arena` label, waiting 5 seconds, and adding it again.

There are three types of errors:
  - Agent side error:
  `‚ùå PR-Arena has failed due to the agent error. Please remove the 'pr-arena' label and add it back to retry.`
  - Workflow side error:
  `‚ùå PR-Arena encountered an error while ___. Please remove the 'pr-arena' label and add it back to retry.`
  - Timeout error:
  `‚è±Ô∏è PR-Arena workflow has been cancelled due to exceeding the 30-minute timeout limit. This may be due to a complex task or an agent error. Please remove the 'pr-arena' label and add it back to retry.`

**Q. How long does the process take?**

A. The time depends on the complexity of the issue. Some reasoning models may take longer to process. Typically, it should take **less than 30 minutes**, so please be patient!

## Security & Permission (üîí)
This GitHub App requires the following permissions:
- **Read & Write access** to Issues and Pull Requests ‚Äî to analyze issues and generate PRs
- **Workflow execution** ‚Äî to trigger automated fixes via GitHub Actions
- **Access to repository contents** ‚Äî to apply code changes and submit pull requests

No user secrets or sensitive information are stored in your repository. All sensitive operations are securely handled through our backend infrastructure.

## Using the GitHub Actions Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that can automatically attempt to generate a pair of pull requests for individual issues labeled with 'pr-arena'. Follow the steps to use this workflow in your own repository:

1. Prepare a github personal access token. You can:
    1. [Contact us](mailto:contact@all-hands.dev) and we will set up a token for the [openhands-agent](https://github.com/openhands-agent) account (if you want to make it clear which commits came from the agent.
    2. Choose your own github user that will make the commits to the repo, [and create a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) with read/write scope for "contents", "issues", "pull requests", and "workflows" on the desired repos.

2. Create an API key for the LLMs you will be setting up for the Arena setting. We usually use a single API key which can access the LLM Router.

3. Copy the `.github/workflows/openhands-resolver.yml` file to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory.

4. Enable read/write workflows for the repository by going to `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions` and selecting "Read and write permissions" and click "Allow Github Actions to create and approve pull requests".

5. Set up the following [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) in your repository, or across your entire org if you want to only set ths once and use the resolver in multiple repositories:
   - `PAT_USERNAME`: The github username that you used to create the personal access token.
   - `PAT_TOKEN`: The personal access token for github.
   - `LLM_MODELS`: The comma seperated LLM models to use (i.e. litellm_proxy/neulab/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620, litellm_proxy/neulab/gpt-4o-2024-05-13, litellm_proxy/neulab/gpt-4o-2024-08-06, litellm_proxy/neulab/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, litellm_proxy/neulab/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo, litellm_proxy/neulab/Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct, litellm_proxy/neulab/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo, litellm_proxy/neulab/NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-405B-Turbo, litellm_proxy/neulab/gemini/gemini-1.5-flash, litellm_proxy/neulab/gemini/gemini-1.5-pro, litellm_proxy/neulab/o1-preview, litellm_proxy/neulab/o1-mini, litellm_proxy/neulab/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct, litellm_proxy/neulab/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, litellm_proxy/neulab/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, litellm_proxy/neulab/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo, litellm_proxy/neulab/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo, litellm_proxy/neulab/deepseek-chat)
   - `LLM_API_KEY`: Your API key to access the LLM Router for the LLM service
   - `LLM_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the LLM API (i.e. https://llm-proxy.app.all-hands.dev)
   - `FIREBASE_CONFIG`: (Only for the prototype) An environment variable containing the Firebase configuration details (e.g., API key, project ID, etc.).


6. To trigger the workflow, add the 'pr-arena' label to any issue you want the AI to attempt to resolve in an Arena setting.

The workflow will:

- Randomly select two LLMs among given `LLM_MODELS` to  attempt to resolve the issue, using the OpenHands resolver and the selected models respectively.
- Create and display two `git_patch`s that corresponds to each of the attempts. (Wait until the GitHub action comments on issue with the webpage URL for you arena!)
- When the user selects one of them, it automatically creates a Pull Request based on the selected model.
- Comment on the issue with the results.
